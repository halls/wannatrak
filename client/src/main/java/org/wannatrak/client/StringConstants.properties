savePeriodInfo=How often location is saved in the mobile phone.<br><br> This option defines the regularity of location data. If you would like to know the every minute device location, make the option less than minute. If you are not interested in minor device movements, make it equal to few minutes.
sendPeriodInfo=How often information are sending to the server.<br><br> This option defines the operation efficiency. For example, if it's important to know all last minute device movements, make it equal few minutes or even 1 minute. If there is no need in immediate data make the option equal few dozen minutes. In such case you can save money reducing Internet traffic and extending battery life-time. It is better to make update time interval bigger than save time interval.
